## 🐾 Makeover Monday: Week 16 – International Pet Ownership

### 🤝 Project Overview

This project is part of the [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) initiative – a global data community challenge aimed at helping people improve their data storytelling and visualization skills by reworking an existing chart using a weekly dataset.

In Week 16 (2025), the dataset explored **pet ownership trends across countries and continents**, tracking percentages of dog, cat, fish, and bird ownership per country.

### 🌟 Objective

The original visualization presented the data accurately but lacked narrative clarity and actionable insights.

My goal was to:

- **Clarify** the core story hidden in the dataset.
- **Break down** the trends into digestible insights.
- **Enhance** the impact through effective visuals and annotations in Tableau.
- **Align** findings with potential business decisions relevant to pet-focused companies.

### 🔍 My Process

#### 1. **Understanding the Dataset**

- Explored pet ownership percentages by country and identified any missing context (e.g., regional groupings).
- Tagged each country with a **region/continent** to better analyze patterns geographically.

#### 2. **Finding Insights**

- Compared **Dog vs Cat** ownership globally.
- Identified **regional trends** (e.g., dog-loving nations in the Americas vs cat-preferred countries in Europe).
- Flagged **outliers** such as Turkey’s high bird ownership and Japan’s low overall pet ownership.

#### 3. **Building the Visual Story in Tableau**

- Created a **series of visualizations** to illustrate:
  - Global preference contrasts (e.g., Dog vs Cat)
  - Region-based pet trends
  - Outliers and surprises
- Combined these into a **Tableau Story** with clear **descriptions and annotations** to guide the reader.

#### 4. **Connecting to Business Impact**

For pet-related businesses (retailers, marketers, product developers), the insights offer:

- Market prioritization by pet type and region
- Tailored messaging based on local preferences
- Emerging opportunities in niche pet categories (like birds in Middle Eastern markets)
